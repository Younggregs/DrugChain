A pharmaceutical drug categorisation application built on a blockchain

Since 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the Bitcoin white paper, a lot has happened. Bitcoin had a slow start, but then picked up considerably well, then Vitalik Buterin came with the game changing modification on Satoshi’s white paper, when he wrote the Ethereum white paper and launched Ethereum.

That was a little history, now there a lot of companies build to supply flexible blockchain integration to various areas of our lives apart from Bitcoin or the Ether such as government, banking and so on.

To take this challenge I researched a lot on blockchain fraweworks such as Hyperledger Fabric, Exonum and so on, and I settled on Parity’s Substrate basically among other factors because of my love for Rust, which Substrate uses and the robuast and easy way to set up, customise, build and launch the blockchain and start producing blocks.

I started a real time p2p blockchain on my machine. And have tried to customise the template to fit pharmaceutical categorisation of drugs, I couldn’t finish in time.

On the other hand I have build the react native app, with a simple interface, for clients to easily categorise a drug, send to the blockchain for consensus and to be added to the blockchain.

My grand plan was to create a platform where Substrate runnable script can run the blockchain on each clients mobile device in the background, while react native would be used basically as the interface, and Substrate has great potential to reach that end.

However I couldn’t finish this project in the time frame because of the scale I’m thinking of, but right the top of head that’s the idea on my head.
